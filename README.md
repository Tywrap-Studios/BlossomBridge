# BlossomBridge
A small API for Tywrap Studios Mods, that adds a few minor things.

---
Such As:
- A fletched Config system utilizing Jankson and some logic magic.
- A simple, yet niche Logging system, to maintain a consistent log format for all our mods.
- Good JavaDocs, so you can actually properly understand the code.
## Project Setup [![](https://jitpack.io/v/Tywrap-Studios/BlossomBridge.svg)](https://jitpack.io/#Tywrap-Studios/BlossomBridge)
Want to use this API in your mod?  
Feel free to! But keep in mind that a lot of stuff in here is specific to our workflows, so it may not be applicable to your use case.  
Plus, the code is pretty minimal the moment, so it's not really worth it half the time.  
### Gradle Setup
BlossomBridge can easily be depended on like any other Fabric mod.  
For a full guide, look at our documentation site: https://docs.tiazzz.me/BlossomBridge/latest/developers/

As an example, I suggest taking a look at [Constructra](https://github.com/Tywrap-Studios/Constructra), which has a lot of this API's code implemented and used.
