# 2.0.2 -> 2.1.0

2.1.0 had one goal: make the project available across any project.

## Updating
Due to the change to be like this and no longer be a mod, you must note that it is recommended to include the artifacts 
with your program, and no longer externally depend on the API. In the getting [started guide](index.md) you can view an 
up-to-date tutorial on how to do this.

Also note that after {==2.1.0==} going forward, we won't be publishing BBAPI on Modrinth anymore. Please include the API in your project.
