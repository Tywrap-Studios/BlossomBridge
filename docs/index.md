# Welcome to BlossomBridge
## Introduction
BlossomBridge is a small API for Tywrap Studios Mods, that adds a few minor things such as:

- A fletched {==Config system :material-cog:==} utilizing {==Jankson :octicons-file-code-16:==} and some logic magic.
- A simple, yet niche {==Logging system :octicons-log-16:==}, to maintain a consistent log format for all our mods.
- All written from the ground in {==Kotlin :simple-kotlin:==}.
