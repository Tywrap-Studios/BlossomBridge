# Welcome to BlossomBridge
## Introduction
BlossomBridge is a small API for Tywrap Studios Projects, which adds a few minor things such as:

- A fletched {==Config system :material-cog:==} utilising {==Jankson :octicons-file-code-16:==} and some logic magic.
- A simple, yet niche {==Logging system :octicons-log-16:==}, to maintain a consistent log format for all our projects.
- All written from the ground up in {==Kotlin :simple-kotlin:==}.
